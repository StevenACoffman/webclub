<h1>A Story of a Thanksgiving Dinner</h1>

<p>Once there live an old retired hunter and his wife who
 were going to host a thanksgiving dinner party this year
for their children and grandchildren. Everything was set
 and ready except the turkey. It was only and hour until
 the guests were to arrive, and they had no turkey. Now,
 this couple lived far out in the country, away from any
 stores, so they couldn't just buy a turkey. Finally, they
 decided that the man should go out and hunt for one. The
man did so, but was not able to come across any turkeys.
All he could find was a fat little bird. He sadly brought
the bird home to his wife, who cooked it and spiced it,
knowing there was no other choice. When it dinner began, the
whole family feasted as merrily as ever. The hunter brought
out the so-called turkey, and to his suprise, everyone loved
it! They said it was the most delicious turkey they had ever
tasted! And it was the hunter's and the hunter's wife's
little secret that the most delicious turkey ever was really
no turkey at all.<p>
