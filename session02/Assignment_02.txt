Change the body color and background-color to make it 
nicer looking and easier to read.

Add some line-breaks,<br>,and remove some other line 
breaks to change the spacing of things on the page.

Change the three headings <h1>, <h2>, <h3> to something 
that makes sense to you.

Add a header above the list(<ol>){animals,foods,people,etc.}

Add at least three list items but try to add more.

Add a list type, <ol type=X>   X can be 1,a,A,i,or I.

Look at the pictures in the /images sub-folder of the 
WebClub folder and use the name of one to replace the 
XXXX.jpg in the img tag.
